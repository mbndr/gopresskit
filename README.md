# Gopresskit

 > **Very early in development**  
 > Completely inspired by [presskit()](https://github.com/ramiismail/dopresskit), more documentation soon.  
 > Currently only the company presskit is generated.

## Why
I like the idea of the original dopresskit but there are a view things I'm no friend of:

##### Deployment
If you want to deploy presskit() you need a PHP server which you have to set up and which is always a potential secure gap. Although it's no web application where are often changes or need user interaction therefore static files would do their job and be a lot faster.

##### Simplicity
I'm a friend of single binaries and very simple configuration for the user. So I like the idea of a simple folder structure for the data, a single config file for page meta data and a single executable for easy generation of static html files.

## Compatibility
I try to be most compatible with the original presskit() but there are a few concepts I don't like so there a a few incompatibilities.

For easy conversion there might be a future command to migrate presskit() data to the structure of this project.

## Example
Currently I'm using most images and videos from [subset games](http://subsetgames.com/presskit/sheet.php?p=into_the_breach) for example presentation. All copyright goes to them.
